# RTRMON
Asus-Merlin Router Monitor (RTRMON) v0.1b

Executive Summary: RTRMON is a shell script that provides near-realtime stats about your Asus-Merlin firmware router using some of the same look and feel of VPNMON-R2. Instead of having to find this information on various different screens or apps, this tool was built to bring all this info together in one stat dashboard. Having a 'system' dashboard showing current CPU, Memory, Disk and Network stats would compliment other dashboard-like scripts greatly (like VPNMON-R2), sitting side-by-side in their own SSH windows to give you everything you need to know with a glance at your screen.

This application is still under heavy development, so things may change, get added, deleted at anytime... please be aware this is BETA territory.
