# RTRMON
Asus-Merlin Router Monitor (RTRMON) v0.1b

RTRMON is a shell script that provides near-realtime stats about your Asus-Merlin firmware router. Instead of having to find this information on various different screens or apps, this tool was built to bring all this info together in one stat dashboard.  VPNMON-R2 is basically a VPN stats dashboard, and believe that having a dashboard showing current CPU, Memory, Disk and Network stats would compiment it greatly sitting side-by-side in their own SSH windows.
