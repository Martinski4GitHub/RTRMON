v1.05     - (July 22, 2022)
          - FIXED: Additional bug that @Stephen Harrington uncovered regarding the WAN DNS NVRAM variable being used, and was yielding some
            different results for him than it was for me.  Changed it to look at a different variable, and built in some more logic that
            picks the DNS entries depending on which WAN connection is active.

v1.04     - (July 22, 2022)
          - ADDED: Additional stats on the networking page, include WAN0, WAN1 and LAN IP addresses... as well as WAN DNS IP addresses! Whoo!
          - CHANGED: Increased the number of digits after the decimal for all networking traffic to show a little more precision.
          - CHANGED: All setup menu's look & feel now match that of VPNMON-R2!  We have achieved congruency!  :)

v1.03     - (July 20, 2022)
          - FIXED - It looks like there was some inconsistency in the way the JFFS partition was being measured as well, and fixed that code to
            be a bit more compliant with returning the right values.

v1.02     - (July 20, 2022)
          - FIXED - Apparently AC68U's have a different way of capturing the CPU temp, and am checking for this alternate way on any router that
            might use the same methods.  So now there's two.  ;)

v1.01     - (July 18, 2022)
          - FIXED - Bug fix that was occasionally being caused by reading a blank NVRAM file causing an arithmetic error!
          - ADDED - capability of checking NVRAM to determine whether your wl0 or wl1 (wireless LANs) are turned on or not, and if not, it will
            show as disabled in the UI - Thanks @Stephen Harrington!
          - ADDED - if someone fat-fingers the temp units other than C, F or K, it will just default to C.          

v1.0      - (July 16, 2022)
          - FIXED - Now allows you to set your WiFi speeds to 0 if you effectively have them disabled (Thanks @Stephen Harrington)
          - FIXED - Changed temp units to force to uppercase during config, and made a small wording change (Thanks @Thirteen)
          
v1.0RC1   - (July 15, 2022)
          - RELEASE - Release Candidate 1 (RC1) is officially out there!
          - ADDED - Added a setup, config, uninstall, and update menu, along with options to view logs, or launch RTRMON regularly in an SSH window,
            or using the screen utility.  Many of these capabilities came over from VPNMON-R2.
          - ADDED - Using proper add-on guidelines, support files are now located under /jffs/addons/rtrmon.d, with the main rtrmon.sh located under
            the /jffs/scripts as usual.
