v1.01     - (TBA)
          - FIXED - Bug fix that was caused by reading a blank NVRAM size used file causing an arithmetic error!
          - ADDED - capability of checking NVRAM to determine whether your wl0 or wl1 (wireless LANs) are turned on or not, and if not, it will
            show as disabled in the UI - Thanks @Stephen Harrington!
          - ADDED - if someone fat-fingers the temp units other than C, F or K, it will just default to C.          

v1.0      - (July 16, 2022)
          - FIXED - Now allows you to set your WiFi speeds to 0 if you effectively have them disabled (Thanks @Stephen Harrington)
          - FIXED - Changed temp units to force to uppercase during config, and made a small wording change (Thanks @Thirteen)
          
v1.0RC1   - (July 15, 2022)
          - RELEASE - Release Candidate 1 (RC1) is officially out there!
          - ADDED - Added a setup, config, uninstall, and update menu, along with options to view logs, or launch RTRMON regularly in an SSH window,
            or using the screen utility.  Many of these capabilities came over from VPNMON-R2.
          - ADDED - Using proper add-on guidelines, support files are now located under /jffs/addons/rtrmon.d, with the main rtrmon.sh located under
            the /jffs/scripts as usual.
