v1.1      - (August 5, 2022)
          - MAJOR: Added a major enhancement to RTRMON -- namely, the commandline Ookla Speedtest binary! Whoo! On the newly added Page 3 of
            the application, you can now initiate a manual speedtest! It will by default use your primary WAN connection and pick the closest
            server to you to run its test, and display these results on Page 3.  These results are saved to a file, so next time you launch
            RTRMON, you will be able to see your last results.  There are no fancy spdMerlin graphs or charts, but just good ol' plain data,
            and some progress indicators giving you a dashboard-like view of your actual vs max WAN up/down speeds. In the setup menu, you
            can now enable 'Ookla Speedtest', which will download and install the binaries. If you disable it, the setup menu will prompt you
            to uninstall these components for you.
          - ADDED: Another variable has been added to capture your WAN upload speed. I personally don't have symmetrical up/download speeds,
            and using this will only give you a better indicator what's happening on your network as it measures and displays these results.
          - ADDED: Additional stats on the networking page, including the WAN and LAN IP6 addresses. Though my alignment OCD will have to live
            with the fact that IP6 addresses are variable length and won't fit nicely between brackets. Thanks to @SomewhereOverTheRainbow for
            his assist in developing the code that pulls this info! RTRMON v1.06b1 additions have been absorbed under this major release.
          
v1.05     - (July 22, 2022)
          - FIXED: Additional bug that @Stephen Harrington uncovered regarding the WAN DNS NVRAM variable being used, and was yielding some
            different results for him than it was for me.  Changed it to look at a different variable, and built in some more logic that
            picks the DNS entries depending on which WAN connection is active.

v1.04     - (July 22, 2022)
          - ADDED: Additional stats on the networking page, include WAN0, WAN1 and LAN IP addresses... as well as WAN DNS IP addresses! Whoo!
          - CHANGED: Increased the number of digits after the decimal for all networking traffic to show a little more precision.
          - CHANGED: All setup menu's look & feel now match that of VPNMON-R2!  We have achieved congruency!  :)

v1.03     - (July 20, 2022)
          - FIXED - It looks like there was some inconsistency in the way the JFFS partition was being measured as well, and fixed that code to
            be a bit more compliant with returning the right values.

v1.02     - (July 20, 2022)
          - FIXED - Apparently AC68U's have a different way of capturing the CPU temp, and am checking for this alternate way on any router that
            might use the same methods.  So now there's two.  ;)

v1.01     - (July 18, 2022)
          - FIXED - Bug fix that was occasionally being caused by reading a blank NVRAM file causing an arithmetic error!
          - ADDED - capability of checking NVRAM to determine whether your wl0 or wl1 (wireless LANs) are turned on or not, and if not, it will
            show as disabled in the UI - Thanks @Stephen Harrington!
          - ADDED - if someone fat-fingers the temp units other than C, F or K, it will just default to C.          

v1.0      - (July 16, 2022)
          - FIXED - Now allows you to set your WiFi speeds to 0 if you effectively have them disabled (Thanks @Stephen Harrington)
          - FIXED - Changed temp units to force to uppercase during config, and made a small wording change (Thanks @Thirteen)
          
v1.0RC1   - (July 15, 2022)
          - RELEASE - Release Candidate 1 (RC1) is officially out there!
          - ADDED - Added a setup, config, uninstall, and update menu, along with options to view logs, or launch RTRMON regularly in an SSH window,
            or using the screen utility.  Many of these capabilities came over from VPNMON-R2.
          - ADDED - Using proper add-on guidelines, support files are now located under /jffs/addons/rtrmon.d, with the main rtrmon.sh located under
            the /jffs/scripts as usual.
